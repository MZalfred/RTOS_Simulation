# RTOS_Simulation

<!-- RTOS Simulation Project - Or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Scheduler ðŸ’£ -->

Overview

So you've stumbled upon my pet project. Think of it as a baby RTOS (Real-Time Operating System). No, it won't wash your car or brew your coffeeâ€”yet. But it will schedule tasks like a boss at an office meeting who just discovered PowerPoint.

<!-- Technologies Used -->

C language: Because why make life easy when you can go C-razy?
GCC: Also known as the "Please Compile, Please" tool.
ZSH Terminal on Mac: Because I like to live life on the edge (of Unix-based systems).

<!-- Challenges -->

Structural Chaos: Took me a while to wrap my head around function pointers. It's like pointing at a cake and magically eating it too.
Scheduler Sorcery: This was the Harry Potter part of the project. Had to wave my coding wand a couple of times before I got the spells right.
Debugging Despair: My terminal turned into a horror movie with errors jumping out at me. Took some garlic, holy water, and a rubber duck to exorcize the code.
Clocks are Hard: You think telling time is easy? Wait till you try to put a clock in a scheduler. Yep, I was ticking off seconds like a time bomb.
The Compilation Abyss: I thought it was gonna be smooth sailing. Spoiler alert: It was more like sailing through a sea of "Where the heck is that file?!"

<!-- Sweet, Sweet Victories ðŸŽ‰ -->

I'm The Scheduler Now: Tasks are lining up at my command like obedient puppies.
Smarty Pants: Who knew Iâ€™d become an overnight C-lebrity and Terminal Guru? Certainly not me.
Debugging Diva: Move over Sherlock, there's a new detective in town.
Sort, Don't Snort: My sorting algorithm could sort out your life problems... if they were numbered between 1 and 10.
Me with my shit Messing around hello no it is Casey is it quit and then changed it minute tender and I'm not planning any plans good good

<!-- How to Fire This Baby Up ðŸ”¥ -->

Unleash your terminalâ€”yes, you know, the black screen that hackers in movies type green stuff into.
Dance your way to the project folder.
Execute gcc main.c -o schedulerApp to compile the beast.
Run ./schedulerApp to unleash the Kraken!

<!-- What's Cookin', Good Lookin'? ðŸ˜Ž -->

More features, like making the tasks fight in a gladiator arena for CPU time.
Optimize sorting so it's faster than you can say "bubble sort" three times fast.
Maybe, just maybe, take over the world. Or, you know, implement more algorithms.
